# AI Model Tier List Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes a detailed comparison of various AI language models, organized into performance tiers (S, A, B, C, D, F) based on their capabilities, cost-efficiency, and practical usability in real-world applications.

## Top-Tier Models

### S-Tier Models
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: 
  - Delivers performance comparable to much more expensive models
  - Significantly cheaper than GPT-4 Mini
  - Exceptionally fast response times
  - Default choice for most everyday tasks
  - Includes built-in search, image recognition, and PDF parsing capabilities

- **Claude 3.5**:
  - Excels at following complex instructions
  - Superior at coding UI and using tools
  - Credited with kickstarting the "agentic revolution"
  - Expensive but worth it for specific use cases
  - Particularly good for developing UI tools and agent-based systems

- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Mini**:
  - Delivers surprising power at a fraction of OpenAI's typical pricing
  - Competent reasoning capabilities
  - Significantly cheaper than GPT-4.0 ($1.10/million input vs $2.50/million)
  - Fast response times

### A-Tier Models
- **Claude 3.7 with reasoning**:
  - Notable for transparency about its reasoning process
  - Unlike competitors, doesn't hide reasoning data
  - Powerful capabilities but tends to "rewrite everything like an excited intern"

- **DeepSeek V3 (0324 edition)**:
  - Performs better than GPT-4.5 at a fraction of the cost
  - $0.27/million input vs GPT-4.5's $75/million
  - Foundation model for DeepSeek's R-series models
  - Underrated compared to the attention its R-series receives

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**:
  - Placed tentatively due to recency
  - Strong benchmark performance
  - Final placement depends on eventual pricing
  - Doesn't expose reasoning data via API despite showing it in UI

- **GPT-4.0 Mini**:
  - Revolutionary for demonstrating value in smaller, faster models
  - Kickstarted the trend toward efficient, affordable AI
  - Delivered impressive performance for its size

## Mid-Tier Models

### B-Tier Models
- **GPT-4.0**:
  - The "middle ground" standard model
  - Solid performance but nothing exceptional
  - Relatively expensive compared to newer alternatives
  - Surpassed by newer models in both performance and price

- **Claude 3.7 (standard)**:
  - Good capabilities but less impressive than its reasoning-enabled version
  - High costs limit practical applications
  - Performs worse than Claude 3.5 for certain tasks despite similar pricing

### C-Tier Models
- **DeepSeek R1**:
  - Revolutionary for bringing reasoning capabilities to open-source
  - Impractical due to extremely slow inference speeds
  - Led to valuable distilled versions that are more practical

- **Llama 3.3** and **Qwen 2.5**:
  - Mediocre standalone performance
  - Valuable as base models for distillation
  - Can perform well when optimized on specialized hardware (Groq)

## Lower-Tier Models

### D-Tier Models
- **GPT-4.5**:
  - Questionable improvements over previous models
  - Extraordinarily expensive ($75/million input tokens)
  - Lost to GPT-4.0 in blind comparison tests
  - Less "personal" than Claude 3.5 despite marketing claims

- **DeepSeek R1 Qwen Distilled**:
  - Functional but quirky
  - Less reliable than Llama-distilled alternatives
  - Reasonable performance-to-cost ratio

- **Gemini Flashlight**:
  - Too close in price to Gemini 2.0 Flash (only 25% cheaper)
  - The small discount doesn't justify the performance tradeoff
  - Hard to justify when Flash is already so affordable

### F-Tier Models
- **Grok 3**:
  - Placed here due to lack of API access rather than performance issues
  - XAI has repeatedly delayed API release for over 1.5 months
  - Impossible to properly evaluate without API access
  - Suspected to be hiding benchmark performance

- **QWQ**:
  - Extremely difficult to get reasonable outputs from
  - Tendency to loop with "wait" or "hm" responses
  - Requires extensive parameter tweaking
  - Minimal usage in the creator's chat app (10,000 uses vs. millions for other models)

## Practical Usage Pattern
The creator's recommended workflow:

1. Start with **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for most queries
   - Fast, cheap, and "good enough" for 90% of tasks
   - Great for general questions and basic coding

2. If unsatisfied, try **GPT-3.5 Mini** for harder problems
   - More powerful reasoning for complex queries
   - Still cost-effective for challenging tasks

3. Use **Claude models** for CSS or visually-oriented tasks
   - Superior at understanding and generating UI code
   - Worth the cost for these specific use cases

4. Use **Claude 3.5** within development tools
   - Particularly valuable in coding environments
   - The default in tools like Cursor

## Business Impact
The creator runs a chat application (T3 Chat) which influenced their rankings. Claude models were noted as being prohibitively expensive, costing "40 times as much money" for half as many messages compared to models like Gemini, forcing them to limit Claude usage in their subscription tiers.

## Model Pricing Highlights
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: $0.125/million input, $0.375/million output
- **GPT-3.5 Mini**: $1.10/million input, $4.40/million output
- **DeepSeek V3**: $0.27/million input, $1.10/million output
- **GPT-4.0**: $2.50/million input, $10.00/million output
- **GPT-4.5**: $75.00/million input, $150.00/million output
- **GPT-4.0 Mini**: $0.15/million input, $0.60/million output
- **Claude models**: Significantly more expensive, causing budget concerns

## Conclusions
The AI model landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with a general trend toward better performance at lower costs. The creator emphasizes that practical considerations like speed, cost, and reliability often outweigh pure performance metrics when choosing models for real-world applications.
