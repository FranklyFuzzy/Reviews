**Legend:**
*   ‚úÖ = Feature Present
*   ‚ùå = Feature Absent
*   üü° = Partial / Limited Feature
*   Limited = Basic functionality may exist, often related to Compose definitions, but not full independent management.

## Key Differences and Parity

**Parity:**

*   All three provide a Web UI for managing Docker resources.
*   All are open-source (Portainer has CE/BE split).
*   All support managing applications via Docker Compose (`stacks` in Portainer terminology).

**Key Differences:**

1.  **Scope & Focus:**
    *   **Komodo & Dockge:** Narrowly focused on making Docker Compose file management easier, primarily for single-host setups. Dockge particularly emphasizes a smooth, reactive editing and update experience for Compose files.
    *   **Portainer:** Broad scope, designed as a comprehensive management platform for the entire Docker ecosystem (containers, images, networks, volumes, stacks) and extending to orchestrators like Swarm and Kubernetes across multiple hosts (endpoints).
2.  **Complexity:**
    *   **Komodo & Dockge:** Aim for simplicity and ease of use, targeting users who are comfortable with Docker Compose but want a GUI helper.
    *   **Portainer:** More complex due to its wider feature set, but still accessible for beginners needing basic container management while scaling to advanced use cases.
3.  **Feature Set:**
    *   **Portainer:** Offers significantly more features like granular resource management (networks, volumes), multi-host support (Endpoints), orchestrator support (Kubernetes, Swarm), application templates, and more robust user management (especially in BE).
    *   **Dockge:** Stands out with its reactive UI, interactive Compose editor, real-time logs, and integrated notification support via Apprise.
    *   **Komodo:** Appears to be the most minimalist, focusing purely on Compose file listing, editing, and basic stack control.
4.  **Target Audience:**
    *   **Dockge:** Ideal for self-hosters managing applications primarily through `docker-compose.yaml` on a single server who want a modern, streamlined interface.
    *   **Komodo:** Suitable for users wanting the absolute simplest GUI for managing Docker Compose files on one machine.
    *   **Portainer:** Caters to a wide range, from individuals managing a single Docker host to teams/businesses managing multiple complex environments (Docker, Swarm, K8s).

## Use Case Summaries

*   **Komodo:** Choose Komodo if you need a very lightweight, no-frills web interface specifically for editing and managing `docker-compose.yaml` files and their corresponding stacks on a *single* Docker host. It's for users who find even Dockge or Portainer too feature-heavy for their simple Compose needs.

*   **Dockge:** Choose Dockge if your primary workflow involves `docker-compose.yaml` files on a *single* Docker host, and you want a modern, reactive, easy-to-use interface focused specifically on managing these stacks. Its strength lies in the interactive editing, deployment, and monitoring of Compose-based applications.

*   **Portainer:** Choose Portainer if you need a comprehensive management solution. This includes managing individual containers, images, networks, volumes, deploying applications via Compose (Stacks) or templates, managing Docker Swarm or Kubernetes clusters, handling multiple Docker environments (endpoints), or requiring user management/RBAC features. It's the most versatile and feature-rich option, suitable for both simple and complex setups.
